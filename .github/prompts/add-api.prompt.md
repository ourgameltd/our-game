# Add API Prompt

Add a code implementation for part of tyhe planned list of moving from static data in my web project to dynamic data via API calls.

## Task

Following the content of the #file:../../docs/api/get-endpoints-task-list.md, there is a list of functionality and section that require to have API endpoints created based on analysis done previously.

I want you to start from where we left off and create the code implementation for the next API endpoint in the list. Please ensure that the code adheres to best practices and is well-documented.


## API Implementation Guidance

There is a list of implementations for endpoitns in the #file:../../docs/api/endpoints/ folder, please refer to it for guidance on how to structure the new endpoints that you are implementing as part of this task.

All APIs build built should used Open API attributes as per existing APIs..

## Client Implementation

The web project should then use these APIs for the consumption of the data instead of static data files. Please ensure that the client code is updated accordingly to use the new API endpoints.

The client code should not generate any new files, but rather update the existing files to include the new API endpoints. If you have to create new files on the client you are doing it wrong.

## Requirements

- Follow the coding standards and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- Ensure the new API endpoint is properly tested.
- Do not worry about documentation for now; focus on the code implementation.
- Make sure to handle potential errors gracefully.
- Ensure the #file:../../docs/api/get-endpoints-task-list.md is updated to reflect the new endpoint added.
